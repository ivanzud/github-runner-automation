# GitHub Runner Automation

**Automate your self-hosted GitHub Actions runners‚Äîone for every repo, no manual setup needed.**

---

## üöß Beta Software ‚Äî Use With Caution

This project is still in **beta**. It is not production-ready. Use at your own risk, and do not rely on it for critical infrastructure without thorough testing and review.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Before You Start: Protect Your Secrets

- **Don't commit your real inventory or vault files to git.**
- This repo includes:
  - `inventory/hosts.example` ‚Äî Example inventory file
  - `group_vars/runner-hosts/vault.yml.example` ‚Äî Example vault file
- **To get started:**
  1. Copy these example files to their real locations:
     - `cp inventory/hosts.example inventory/hosts`
     - `cp group_vars/runner-hosts/vault.yml.example group_vars/runner-hosts/vault.yml`
  2. Edit them with your real server info and secrets.
- Your real files are ignored by git and will never be uploaded.

## What Does This Project Do?

**This automation will automatically provision a self-hosted GitHub Actions runner for every repository in your organization or user account that uses `runs-on: self-hosted` in its workflow.**

- No more manual runner setup for each repo.
- Add a new repo or workflow? The system detects it and spins up a runner for you.
- Remove a repo? The runner is cleaned up automatically.
- All runners are managed via Ansible and a simple web interface.

This is perfect for teams or individuals who want to scale self-hosted runners across many repos, without the headache of manual management.

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites

- Ansible installed on your management machine
- Python 3 (for the web UI)
- SSH access to your runner servers (root or sudo)
- GitHub Personal Access Token with `repo` and `admin:org` permissions

### 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/github-runner-automation.git
cd github-runner-automation
```

### 3. Configure Your Servers and GitHub Token

Edit `inventory/hosts` and add your servers:

```ini
[runner-hosts]
runner-01 ansible_host=YOUR_SERVER_IP ansible_user=root

[runner-hosts:vars]
ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3
```

Edit `group_vars/runner-hosts/vault.yml`:

```yaml
github_token: "ghp_your_github_token_here"
github_username: "your-github-username"
scan_interval_minutes: 5
```

### 4. Deploy Everything

```bash
./install.sh
```

This will:

- Install all dependencies
- Set up systemd services and timers
- Register runners on all servers

### 5. Start the Web Management Interface

```bash
cd web-gui
./start.sh
```

Open your browser to: **http://localhost:8080**

## Why Use This?

- **Zero manual runner setup:** Just add a repo with `runs-on: self-hosted` and it gets a runner.
- **Easy scaling:** Add/remove servers in your inventory, and the system handles the rest.
- **Web dashboard:** See all your runners, servers, and logs in one place.
- **Beta quality:** This is still experimental‚Äîexpect bugs and rough edges.

---

## Web Interface Features

- **Dashboard:** See all servers, runners, and their status
- **Server Management:** Add/remove servers, view details
- **Runner Control:** Start/stop/restart runners
- **Configuration:** Edit GitHub token and settings
- **Logs:** View recent automation activity

---

## Useful Commands

Check automation status:

```bash
ansible -i inventory/hosts runner-hosts -m shell -a "systemctl status github-runner-auto-register.timer"
```

Check active runners:

```bash
ansible -i inventory/hosts runner-hosts -m shell -a "systemctl list-units --type=service | grep github-runner"
```

Trigger manual scan:

```bash
ansible -i inventory/hosts runner-hosts -m shell -a "/usr/local/bin/register-github-runners"
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Web UI not starting?**
  - Check Python version (3.7+ recommended)
  - Run `pip install -r web-gui/requirements.txt`
- **SSH errors?**
  - Ensure your SSH key is on all servers
  - Check `ansible_user` and `ansible_host` in inventory
- **Runners not registering?**
  - Check your GitHub token permissions
  - View logs in `/var/log/github-runner-auto-register.log`

---

## Security

- GitHub token is stored securely in the vault file
- Uses SSH key authentication for all server access
- Runners run as a dedicated system user
